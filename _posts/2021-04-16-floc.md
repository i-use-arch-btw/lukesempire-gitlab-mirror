[Googleâ€™s FLoC Is a Terrible Idea](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea).
According to the EFF,
>The technology will avoid the privacy risks of third-party cookies, but it will create new ones in the process. It may also exacerbate many of the worst non-privacy problems with behavioral ads, including discrimination and predatory targeting. 

So, I have opted out this website from FLoC. To do this for your own, see [this article.](https://paramdeo.com/blog/opting-your-website-out-of-googles-floc-network)
